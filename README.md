## System-Dev-Final-Project
The problem domain of this project is healthcare and pharmaceuticals industry. In this industry, communication is lax and streamlining communication between healtcare providers and pharaceutical industry is paramount.

I am interested in using a designed technology system to improve communication and coordination in healthcare and pharmaceutical industry. I believe that a well-designed software system can play a key role in addressing this issue in both interconnected industries.

A prototype system that allows for easy and secure communication between healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies. This system would include several easy-to-use features such as secure messaging, file sharing, and appointment scheduling is the scope of this system being developed.
