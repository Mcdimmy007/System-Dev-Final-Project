# Python-Pharma-Health Chat App 

## System-Dev-Final-Project
The problem domain of this project is healthcare and pharmaceuticals industry. In this industry, communication is lax and streamlining communication between healtcare providers and pharaceutical industry is paramount.

I am interested in using a designed technology system to improve communication and coordination in healthcare and pharmaceutical industry. I believe that a well-designed software system can play a key role in addressing this issue in both interconnected industries.

A prototype system that allows for easy and secure communication between healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies. This system would include several easy-to-use features such as secure messaging, file sharing, and appointment scheduling is the scope of this system being developed.

I had to reduce the scope of the project to only reflect secure messaging between the healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies. Including file sharing and appointment scheduling like I originally planned was a bit too much, I therefore decided to go with the most important aspect of the prototype. 

This prototype app is in the form of a chatroom where users can register with a username and login information and enter a chatroom to have secure communication. If no chatroom exists, one can be created and the code can be given to other participants to join the chat room as well. I used socketio framework in Flask to execute this connection. Socketio can have up to 1400 concurrent connections at a time.
